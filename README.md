# Capstone Project - Books Management Application

This is the backend of a Books Management Application, as part of the capstone project for the Udacity Cloud Developer
Nanodegree, built using NodeJs and AWS services. There is no client application for it. For convenience and test
purposes the interaction with the backend is done via Postman and/or scripts.
